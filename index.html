    <h2>The reason rivals is so popular is becuse There big updaits.</h2><br>
    
<I>For example the rank update was amazing So many people were playing.<br>
That the serever litteraly was creashing due to the amount of people.<br>
Althogh recently rivals has been averging less and less players<br> </I>

<h2>The resoun rivals is averging less and players is because of the hackers<br></h2>
    
<I>For Example when rank was new there yoused to be a hacker at evr match<br>
Many people also have complained abiut the issue of bugs<br>
Now rivals when it was more new had way more bugs<br>
But players thoght that rivals whas gonna fix it as the game grew older<br>
But no after one hole year of the game there is still so many bugs in the game<br>
After the origanal creater Kroo departed the game dose not feel the same anymore<br> </p> </I>
